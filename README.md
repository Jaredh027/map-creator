# PathPilot

**PathPilot** is a React-based application designed for airport self-service kiosks. After scanning a boarding pass, travelers can add as many stops as they likeâ€”grabbing food, finding restrooms, visiting shops, or heading straight to their gate. The app instantly produces a color-coded route on two synchronized maps:

* **Airport overview:** a zoomed-out aerial map that shows the full path across terminals.
* **Terminal detail:** a focused floor plan of the destination terminal with clearly labeled gates, stores, and amenities.

The interface uses large text and high-contrast colors to assist older travelers. Each map can be printed or transferred to a phone (QR / SMS), so users never have to worry about installing an app or finding Wi-Fi.
